Code can be found at: https://github.com/jonmpqts/ml-pr4

All code written in Python 3 and LaTeX. The required Python libraries are
included in the file requirements.txt. A Makefile is supplied that will run
all code, build graphs, and report. This is the default output target and can be run
with:

make

The Makefile also creates a virtualenv and installs the necessary dependencies
with pip. This will also attempt to generate the analysis which is in a separate
repo linked as a submodule. Access can be provided to this repo also if needed.
